      <p>Hello, I am Murphy Poxson</p>
      <p>
        I am a computer science major at Oakland University and I am graduating
        May 2024. I grew up in Sterling Heights, Michigan and I graduated as a
        valedictorian from Henry Ford II High School. The past two summers I
        interned at Ally Financial in Detroit. I was an Automation Engineer for
        both internships. During the school year, I work as an IT Assistant for
        Oakland University. Before I came to OU, I worked at MJR Digital Cinemas
        as an usher and a supervisor. I would like to work as a software
        developer in the future. You can learn more about me on my
        <a href="./html/my_fun_facts.html">Fun Facts page</a> and on my
        <a href="./html/my_resume.html">Resume page</a>.
